# Web-Design-Site

Website I made for my Spring Semester Project in Web Design. I did not spend a lot of time on this website (more important classes to focus on), so it doesn't look the best. It is lacking with CSS and other content, but this was a learning experience in which I was able to apply HTML onto a website of my own.
