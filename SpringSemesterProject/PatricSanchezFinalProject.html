<h4 class="Content">Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h4>
<img src="Images/CPU-img.jpg" alt="CPU" height=225px width=400px>
<p style="text-align:left"> The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is a piece of hardware that carries out the instructions of a computer program. It performs the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of a 
computer system. The CPU is like the brains of the computer - every instruction, no matter how simple, has to go through the CPU. So let's say you press the letter 'k' on your keyboard and it appears on the screen - the CPU of your 
computer is what makes this possible. The CPU is sometimes also referred to as the central processor unit, or processor for short. So when you are looking at the specifications of a computer at your local electronics store, it typically
refers to the CPU as the processor.
<br><br><br>
When we start to look at the various components of a CPU and how they function, remember that this is all about speed. When we use a computer, we want the instructions to be carried out very fast. As the instructions become more complicated 
(for example, creating a 3D animation or editing a video file), we demand more from the CPU. Thus, the technological advances we have seen in processor technology have largely been driven by the need for speed.
<br><br><br>
CPUs are located on the motherboard. Motherboards have a socket for this, which is specific for a certain type of processor. A CPU gets very hot and therefore needs its own cooling system in the form of a heat sink and/or fan.
All computers require a Central Processing Unit in order to properly function as it executes the operating system and execution of software.</p>
</div>
<br>


<h4 class="Content">The Motherboard</h4>
<img src="Images/Motherboard-img.jpg" alt="CPU" height=225px width=400px>
<p  style="text-align:left">The motherboard is the backbone that ties the computerâ€™s components together at one spot and allows them to talk to each other. Without it, none of the computer pieces, such as the CPU, GPU, or hard drive, could 
interact. Total motherboard functionality is necessary for a computer to work well. If your motherboard is on the fritz, expect some big problems.
<br><br><br>
A motherboard from one manufacturer will support a single type of CPU and a few different types of memory. Other peripherals like video cards, hard drives and other components may not be compatible.This means the choice of your motherboard can
regulate your options when selecting components. It can control things such as what type of processor you can use, how much RAM memory it can have and what features it can support. This is why it is important to have a rough idea of what you 
need when selecting the right motherboard. For instance, there are three sizes for a motherboard: ATX, Micro-ATX, and Mini-ATX.
<br><br><br>
It is important to note the numerous types of connectors that are located within a motherboard. These include: USB ports, a network port for wifi connection, storage connection to a mechanical drive (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD), expansion 
slots (PCI-E x1, x4, x16), etc. The motherboard has different connections that are to be all plugged in to work synchronously. A motherboard allows for future expansion, so don't worry if there are empty slots in your computer. </p>

<h4 class="Content">The RAM</h4>
<img src="Images/RAM-IMG.jpg" alt="RAM" height=225px width=400px>
<p class="Content">RAM (Random Access Memory) is the hardware in a computing device where the operating system (OS), application programs and data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device's processor.
RAM is the main memory in a computer. It is much faster to read from and write to than other kinds of storage, such as a hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD) or optical drive.
<br><br><br>
Because of its volatility, RAM can't store permanent data. RAM can be compared to a person's short-term memory, and a hard disk drive to a person's long-term memory. Short-term memory is focused on immediate work, but it can only keep 
a limited number of facts in view at any one time. When a person's short-term memory fills up, it can be refreshed with facts stored in the brain's long-term memory. A computer also works this way. If RAM fills up, the computer's processor must 
repeatedly go to the hard disk to overlay the old data in RAM with new data. This process slows the computer's operation.
<br><br><br>
The amount of RAM needed all depends on what the user is doing. When video editing, for example, it's recommended that a system have at least 16 GB RAM, though more is desirable. For photo editing using Photoshop, Adobe recommends a system have
at least 3GB of RAM to run Photoshop CC on a Mac. However, if the user is working with other applications at the same time, even 8GB of RAM can slow things down.</p>

<h4 class="Content">Graphics Card</h4>
<img src="Images/GraphicsCard-IMG.jpg" alt="Graphics Card" height=225px width=400px>
<p class="Content">The main function of a graphics card is to produce the image that you see on your screen/monitor. Without a video card, you would not be able to see this page. More plainly, it's a piece of hardware inside your 
computer that processes images and video, some of the tasks normally handled by the CPU.
<br><br><br>
The better your graphics card the better, and smoother an image can be produced. This is naturally very important for gamers and video editors. High-end GPUs are used for gaming, ray tracing, graphics production, and even mining cryptocurrency.
Modern graphics cards are extremely sophisticated devices that in some ways behave like stand-alone computers. They perform an enormous number of calculations and are typically the most sophisticated components in a computer.

<br><br><br>
There are two types of graphics cards: Integrated GPU and Discrete GPU. An integrated GPU is built into the motherboard and cannot be upgraded or replaced. You'll find this in laptops and inexpensive desktop PCs.A discrete GPU is mounted on a graphics
 card that slips into a computer's expansion slot on the motherboard. This kind of graphics card is replaceable so it can be upgraded as newer graphics cards are developed and helps keep a PC from becoming obsolete.

<h4 class="Content">Power Supply</h4>
<img src="Images/PowerSupply-IMG.jpg" alt="Power Supply" height=225px width=400px>
<p class="Content">The Power Supply of a computer converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer. They also provide a signal to the motherboard to indicate when the DC voltages 
  are in spec, so that the computer is able to safely power up and boot.
<br><br><br>
Most modern desktop personal computer power supplies conform to the ATX specification, which includes form factor and voltage tolerances. While an ATX power supply is connected to the mains supply, it always provides a 5-volt standby (5VSB) 
power so that the standby functions on the computer and certain peripherals are powered. The desktop computer power supply changes alternating current from a wall socket of mains electricity to low-voltage direct current to operate the processor and peripheral devices.
<br><br><br>
In a personal computer (PC), the power supply is the metal box usually found in a corner of the case. The power supply is visible from the back of many systems because it contains the power-cord receptacle and the cooling fan.
Without it, a computer is just an inert box full of plastic and metal.</p>
